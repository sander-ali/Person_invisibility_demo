# Person_invisibility_demo
Person invisibility demo using OpenCV and Python
This code is not perfect as it is based on "Histogram of Oriented GRadients" to detect the person and the fps is slow due to the usage of shallow learning. 

I am working on more sophisticated instance segmentation algorithm which are fast and reliable as well, will update this repository accordingly.
